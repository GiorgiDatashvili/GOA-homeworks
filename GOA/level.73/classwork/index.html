            <h2>About Dexter</h2>
            <p>
              Dexter is an American crime drama television series that aired on
              Showtime from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013. Set in
              Miami, the series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a
              forensic technician specializing in blood spatter analysis for the
              fictional Miami Metro Police Department, who leads a secret
              parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down murderers
              inadequately punished by the justice system due to corruption or
              legal technicalities. The show's first season was derived from the
              novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first in a series of
              novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by James
              Manos Jr., who wrote the first episode. The series enjoyed mostly
              positive reviews throughout its run. The first four seasons were
              widely praised, but reception dropped considerably as the series
              progressed, with the final season and especially the series finale
              being highly criticized and often cited as amongst the worst of
              all time. The show has received myriad awards, including two
              Golden Globes won by Hall and John Lithgow for their roles as
              Dexter Morgan and Arthur Mitchell, respectively. The fourth season
              aired its season finale on December 13, 2009, to a record-breaking
              audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched
              original series episode ever on Showtime at that time. The eighth
              season served as the final season of Dexter; the season premiere
              was the most watched Dexter episode, with more than 3 million
              viewers total, while the series finale drew 2.8 million viewers,
              the largest audience in Showtime's history. Dexter has continued
              through an expanded franchise with further series. The sequel
              series Dexter: New Blood aired from November 2021 to January 2022,
              with Hall reprising the title role and Clyde Phillips as
              showrunner. The prequel series Dexter: Original Sin premiered in
              December 2024, starring Patrick Gibson as Dexter. Further series
              are in development, including Dexter: Resurrection, and Trinity
              Killer, a spin-off prequel series.
