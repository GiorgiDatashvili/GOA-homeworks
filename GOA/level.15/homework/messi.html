    <p>Lionel Andrés Messi (born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who
        plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team.
        Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades
        won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d'Or awards and eight times being named
        the world's best player by FIFA. He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football
        having won 45 team trophies, including twelve league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa
        Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals for a
        single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most matches
        played (39), assists (18) and goal contributions (34) in the Copa América, most matches played (26) and goal
        contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (189) and international goals (112) by a
        South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative
        playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals for club and country.</p>

    </center>
    <p>A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the
        six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the
        near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing
        ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. His goalscoring idol growing up was
        Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".

        However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth
        hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which
        cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. He was
        scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised. It was speculated
        that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed
        that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him.</p>

    <p>Barcelona (2004–2021)
        2004–2008: Rise to the first team

        Messi (pictured in 2005) at the age of 18 playing for FC Barcelona, where he played for 17 years.
        Messi would begin the 2004–05 season as a guaranteed starter for the Barcelona B team, but after some lobbying
        by the senior players, he would be promoted to the first team by manager Frank Rijkaard. He made his La Liga
        debut for Barcelona on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol, and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005
        against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the
        club. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent
        Barcelona in an official competition, and the club would win the league title during that season.

        On his 18th birthday, he would sign his first contract as a senior team player, which would be updated three
        months later to keep him at the club until 2014. Barcelona would begin the 2005–06 season by winning the
        Supercopa de España without Messi, who was not selected to participate in the competition. By the end of the
        season, the team would win La Liga again as well as the UEFA Champions League, although Messi would not play in
        the final for the latter due to injury.</p>
