    <h1 id="football">Football</h1>
    <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of
        11 players each, who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a
        pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the
        goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played
        over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in
        over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</p>

    <p>Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. The Chinese competitive game cuju
        (蹴鞠, literally "kickball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football as well as a mix of
        basketball, and volleyball. ] This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is historical
        evidence. The game was first recorded as in exercise in the Zhan Guo Ce, a military history from the Han
        dynasty. Cuju players would pass the ball around, having to avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was
        then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a circular goal atop 10-11
        meter poles. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.
        The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju outside of China, especially the form of the game popular in
        the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[21] Other East
        Asian games include kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju. Kemari originated after the
        year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking
        of a mari, a ball made of animal skin. In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the
        Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the
        same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals".</p>
