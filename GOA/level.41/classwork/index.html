    <h1>Interstellar</h1>
    <p>Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay
        with his brother Jonathan Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin,
        Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight
        and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new
        home for mankind.

        The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by
        Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the
        film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of Interstellar. It was Lynda Obst's final film as producer before
        her death. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and
        IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses
        extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.

        Interstellar was released in theaters on November 7, 2014. In the United States, it was first released on film
        stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed
        $681 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014.
        Among its various accolades, Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best
        Visual Effects.</p>
