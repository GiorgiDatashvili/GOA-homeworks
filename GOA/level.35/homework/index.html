    <h1>Robert Downey Jr.</h1>
    <p>Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor. His films as a leading actor have grossed
        over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Downey's career has been
        characterized by some early success, a period of drug-related problems and run-ins with the law, and a surge in
        popular and commercial success since the late 2000s.[2] In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine as one of the
        100 most influential people in the world. From 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid
        actor.

        At the age of five, Downey made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s 1970 film Pound. He
        subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987).
        Downey's portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic Chaplin garnered him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor and
        his first Academy Award nomination. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug
        charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal in 2000 and won a Golden Globe Award for the role. Downey was fired
        from the show in 2001 in the wake of additional drug charges. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment
        program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.

        Downey made his acting comeback in the 2003 film The Singing Detective, after Mel Gibson paid his insurance bond
        because completion bond companies would not insure him,[3] and went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss
        Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007) and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008). Downey gained global
        recognition for starring as Iron Man in ten Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, from Iron Man (2008) to
        Avengers: Endgame (2019). He also played Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned
        him his second Golden Globe, and in its 2011 sequel.

        Downey has also taken on dramatic parts in The Judge (2014) and Oppenheimer (2023), winning an Academy Award, a
        Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the latter. He
        was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for playing multiple characters in the black comedy miniseries The
        Sympathizer (2024), and made his Broadway debut that year, playing the title role in Ayad Akhtar's McNeal.</p>
