                <h1>Georgia (country)
                </h1>
                <p>Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, ) is a transcontinental country in
                    Eastern Europe and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the
                    west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and
                    Azerbaijan
                    to
                    the southeast. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi). It has a
                    population of
                    3.7 million, of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are
                    native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation.

                    Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking,
                    gold
                    mining, and textiles. The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis
                    and
                    Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century, Georgians
                    officially adopted Christianity, which contributed to the unification into the Kingdom of Georgia.
                    Georgia
                    reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen
                    Tamar.
                    Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various
                    regional
                    powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, before being gradually annexed into
                    the
                    Russian Empire starting in 1801.

                    After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under
                    German
                    protection, but was invaded and annexed by the Red Army in 1921, becoming one of the Republics of
                    the
                    Soviet Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, leading to Georgia's secession
                    from
                    the
                    Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the country endured economic crises,
                    political instability, and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful
                    Rose
                    Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of
                    democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO. This Western
                    orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008
                    and
                    continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia.

                    Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic. It is a
                    developing country, with a very high Human Development Index and an emerging market economy.
                    Sweeping
                    economic reforms since 2003 have resulted in one of the freest business climates in the world,
                    greater
                    economic freedom and transparency, and among the fastest rates of GDP growth. In 2018, Georgia
                    became
                    the second country in the world to legalize cannabis, and the first former socialist state to do so.
                    Georgia
                    is a member of numerous international organizations, including the Council of Europe, Eurocontrol,
                    BSEC,
                    GUAM, Energy Community. As part of the Association Trio, Georgia is a candidate for membership in
                    the
                    European Union.</p>

                <h1>Golden Age and Division
                </h1>
                <p>or much of the 11th century, the nascent Georgian kingdom experienced geopolitical and internal
                    difficulties, with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state. They
                    were often backed by the Byzantine Empire, which feared a dominion of the Caucasus region by the
                    Bagrationi dynasty, and in some instances fueled internal conflict through aristocratic families
                    seeking more power. However, ties between Byzantium and Georgia were normalized when the two
                    countries faced a new common enemy, the rising Seljuk Empire in the 1060s. Following the decisive
                    Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Constantinople started to retreat from eastern
                    Anatolia and entrusted Georgia with its administration, placing Georgia at the forefront of Turkish
                    in the 1080s.

                    The Kingdom of Georgia reached its zenith in the 12th to early 13th centuries. This period during
                    the reigns of David IV (r. 1089–1125) and his great-granddaughter Tamar (r. 1184–1213) has been
                    widely termed as the Georgian Golden Age.This early Georgian renaissance, which preceded its
                    Western European analog, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion,
                    and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences. The Golden
                    Age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem
                    The Knight in the Panther's Skin, considered a national epic.

                    David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized power in his hands to effectively deal
                    with foreign threats. In 1121, he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the Battle
                    of Didgori and abolished the Emirate of Tbilisi.


                    Queen Tamar, the first woman to rule medieval Georgia in her own right.
                    The 29-year reign of Tamar, the first female ruler of Georgia, is considered the most successful in
                    Georgian history. Tamar was given the title "king of kings" and succeeded in neutralizing
                    her opposition, while embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by the downfall of the rival
                    powers of the Seljuks and Byzantium. Supported by a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build
                    on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire that dominated the Caucasus, and
                    extended over large parts of present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, eastern Turkey, and northern Iran, and
                    used the vacuum of power left by the Fourth Crusade to create the Empire of Trebizond as a Georgian
                    vassal state.

                    The revival of the Kingdom of Georgia was set back after Tbilisi was captured and destroyed by the
                    Khwarezmian leader Jalal ad-Din in 1226,[64] followed by devastating invasions by Mongol ruler
                    Genghis Khan. The Mongols were expelled by George V the Brilliant (r. 1299–1302), known for
                    reuniting eastern and western Georgia and restoring the country's previous strength and Christian
                    culture. After his death, local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule,
                    until the total disintegration of the kingdom in the 15th century. Georgia was further weakened by
                    several disastrous invasions by Timur. Invasions continued, giving the kingdom no time for
                    restoration, with both Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans constantly raiding its southern
                    provinces.</p>
