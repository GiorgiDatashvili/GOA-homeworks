        <h1>Daniel Craig</h1>
        <p>Daniel Wroughton Craig (born 2 March 1968) is an English actor. He gained international fame by playing the
            fictional secret agent James Bond for five installments in the film series: Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of
            Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015), and No Time to Die (2021).

            After training at the National Youth Theatre in London and graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and
            Drama in 1991, Craig began his career on stage. He began acting with the drama The Power of One (1992), and
            had his breakthrough role in the drama serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He gained prominence for his
            supporting roles in films such as Elizabeth (1998), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), Road to Perdition
            (2002), Layer Cake (2004), and Munich (2005).

            In 2006, Craig played Bond in Casino Royale, a reboot of the Bond franchise which was favourably received by
            critics and earned Craig a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His non-Bond
            appearances since then include roles in the fantasy film The Golden Compass (2007), the drama Defiance
            (2008), the science fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens (2011), the mystery thriller The Girl with the Dragon
            Tattoo (2011), and the heist film Logan Lucky (2017). For his performance as Detective Benoit Blanc in the
            Knives Out film series (2019, 2022), he received two Golden Globe Award nominations.

            On stage, Craig starred in the Royal National Theatre's production of Angels in America (1993) on the West
            End. He made his Broadway debut in the play A Steady Rain (2009) and returned to Broadway in the revivals of
            Harold Pinter's Betrayal (2011) and William Shakespeare's Macbeth (2022). He starred as Iago in the New York
            Theatre Workshop production of Othello (2016).</p>
