            <p>Topuria was born in Halle Westfalen, Germany to Georgian parents who were refugees from
                Abkhazia.

            </h2>
            <h3>Early career
            </h3>
            <p>Topuria started his career with four straight submission wins on the Spanish regional scene and won a
                belt in Mix Fight Events promotion. In 2018, he competed in his first international fight in Cage MMA
                Finland. In the same year, in May, he became the first Georgian black belt in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu
                alongside his brother Alex Topuria. Months later he received the opportunity to fight for the Cage
                Warriors Bantamweight Championship at the Lotto Arena in Antwerp, Belgium. Ilia failed to make the
                agreed weight so despite winning the fight quickly, he did not get the belt.

                In 2019, he signed with Brave Combat Federation. Ilia made his promotional debut in Bogotá,
                Colombia, defeating Luis Gomez in the first round by submission; which earned him the award for
                best performance of the night. On November 15, 2019, in Bahrain, he won his second fight in BRAVE by
                defeating Steven Goncalves by KO in the first round</p>
            <h3>Ultimate Fighting Championship
            </h3>
            <p>Topuria, as a replacement for Seung Woo Choi, took a bout on short notice against Youssef Zalal on
                October 11, 2020 at UFC Fight Night: Moraes vs. Sandhagen. Topuria won the fight via unanimous
                decision.

                Topuria faced Damon Jackson on December 5, 2020, at UFC on ESPN: Hermansson vs. Vettori. He won the
                fight via knockout in round one.

                Topuria faced Ryan Hall on July 10, 2021, at UFC 264. He won the fight via knockout in round
                one.

                Topuria was scheduled to face Movsar Evloev on January 22, 2022, at UFC 270. However, Evloev
                withdrew from the bout for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Charles Jourdain. However,
                Topuria was pulled from the card due to a medical issue related to cutting weight and the bout was
                cancelled.
                Topuria faced Jai Herbert, replacing Mike Davis, on March 19, 2022, at UFC Fight Night 204. Topuria
                suffered a knockdown from a head kick in round one, but recovered and won the fight via knockout in
                round two. With this win, he received the Performance of the Night award.

                Topuria was scheduled to face Edson Barboza on October 29, 2022, at UFC Fight Night 213. However,
                Barboza withdrew in late September due to a knee injury and the bout was cancelled.

                Topuria faced Bryce Mitchell on December 10, 2022, at UFC 282. He won the fight via submission in
                round two. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award.

                Topuria was initially scheduled to face Josh Emmett on June 17, 2023, at UFC on ESPN 47. However,
                the promotion later announced that the bout was shifted to headline UFC on ABC: Emmett vs. Topuria on
                June 24, 2023. He won the fight via unanimous decision. The bout earned him the Fight of the
                Night award.

                UFC Featherweight Champion
                In October 2023, Topuria was scheduled to face Alexander Volkanovski on January 20, 2024, for the UFC
                Featherweight Championship at UFC 297. However, on ten days notice replacing an injured Charles
                Oliveira, Volkanovski faced Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship at UFC 294 on October
                21, 2023, and was knocked out in the first round. As a result, Topuria vs. Volkanovski was pushed
                back one month to headline UFC 298 on February 17, 2024. Topuria won the featherweight championship
                via knockout in the second round, ending Volkanovski's four-year reign as champion. This fight
                earned him the Performance of the Night award.

                Topuria defended his UFC Featherweight Championship against former champion Max Holloway on October 26,
                2024, at UFC 308. He won the fight by knockout in the third round, leading to the first knockout
                loss of Holloway's career. This fight earned him another Performance of the Night award.</p>
