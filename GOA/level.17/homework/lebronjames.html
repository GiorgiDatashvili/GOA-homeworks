            <p>LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional
                basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed
                "King James", he is widely recognized as one of the greatest players in the sport's history and is often
                compared with Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] James has
                won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances
                between 2011 and 2018. He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and three Olympic
                gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team.

                In addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in career assists, James holds
                several individual honors: four Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four Finals MVP Awards, three
                All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an All-Star a record 20
                times, selected to the All-NBA Team 20 times (including 13 First Team selections) and the
                All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice
                in his career. The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record
                for the most seasons played in league history, with 22.

                James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He
                was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing,
                athleticism and playmaking abilities.A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers
                with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon
                established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA
                Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. James left in 2010 as a
                free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The
                Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history, despite the show
                raising millions for national charities.

                James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these
                years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in
                2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to
                victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the
                team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his
                contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA
                championship and his fourth Finals MVP. On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
                become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first
                father-son teammates in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers.

                Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the
                first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. James has been
                featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer),
                and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013,
                2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted
                Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a
                part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened
                an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.</p>

            <h2 id="earlylife">Early life
            </h2>
            <p>James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time
                of his birth.: 22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not
                involved in his life. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family,
                as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled
                to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment,
                Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who
                introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.: 23 

                James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade. He later played Amateur Athletic Union
                (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. The team enjoyed success on a local and
                national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.: 24  The
                group dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other that they would attend high school
                together.: 27  In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary
                High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="highschool">High school
            </h2>
            <h3>Basketball
            </h3>
            <p>As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St.
                Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team. The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III
                state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated. As
                a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per
                game. For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of
                Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA
                scouts who wanted to see James play. The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as
                state champions. For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the
                USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.

                In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam
                magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01
                m), as "[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now". During the season,
                James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball
                underclassman to do so.: 104  With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per
                game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, and
                became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.: 117  St.
                Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division
                II championship game.: 114  Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the
                NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft. During this time, he
                used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media
                attention he was receiving.

                Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of
                nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was
                nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity,
                offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view
                basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.: 143  For the year, James
                averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game, was named Ohio Mr.
                Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive
                year,: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.
                He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic,
                the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate
                Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA
                draft.

                Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday,
                James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a
                loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player. This prompted an
                investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no
                amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of
                any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or
                any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an
                urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting
                in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his
                penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year.
                The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In
                his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points. St. Vincent–St. Mary
                went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.
            </p>
            <h3>Football
            </h3>
            <p>As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.: 51  He was
                recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. At the end of his second year, James
                was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state
                semifinals. James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in
                an AAU basketball game.Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as
                former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National
                Football League (NFL).

            <h3>Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)</h3>
            <h4>2003–2004: Rookie of the Year
            </h4>
            <p>James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003
                NBA draft. In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the
                Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut
                performance. At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive
                the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists
                per game, he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five
                rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie. Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47,
                failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.</p>
            <h4>2004–2008: Rise to superstardom
            </h4>
            <p>In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8.0
                rebounds, and 6.0 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference. Around the league, teams
                took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: "It's
                weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the
                exception to almost every rule." On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors,
                setting Cleveland's new single-game points record. With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds,
                7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team. Despite a 30–20 record
                to start the year, the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.


                James picks up his dribble against Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards in November 2006.
                At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star
                Game Most Valuable Player. Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6
                assists per game, he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve
                Nash. Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since
                1998. In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the
                Washington Wizards. In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and
                made another in Game 5. Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the
                Detroit Pistons in the second round.


                James engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008; the routine
                was mostly ended after 2011.
                In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0
                assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden,
                Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the
                second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[60] In the
                first two rounds of the playoffs, Lebron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey
                Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the
                Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is
                considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30
                points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won
                109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer
                Marv Albert called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color
                commentator Steve Kerr described it as "Jordan-esque".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the
                fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their
                first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the
                Finals.[64] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony
                Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its
                defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot
                yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense. He
                averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting, as
                Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.

                In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a
                27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance. On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as
                the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer
                games than Daugherty. James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his
                first scoring title. Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year
                before to 45–37. Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards
                in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the
                eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round. During the decisive seventh game in Boston,
                James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a
                "shootout".</p>

            <h4>2008–2010: MVP seasons
            </h4>
            <p>At the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award
                voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93
                total blocks. James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points,
                rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of
                All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of
                matching the best home record in league history. With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds,
                7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP
                Award. Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: "He's having what is
                arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it."

                In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the
                Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on
                66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the
                series at 1–1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James
                immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media
                members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and
                8.0 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.

                In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series
                of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no
                momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.
                Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7
                points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to
                another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup
                with the Boston Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in
                Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered
                its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a
                smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the
                postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing
                effort.</p>
