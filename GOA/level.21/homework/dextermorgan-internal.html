            <p class="p-1">Dexter Morgan, also known as The Bay Harbor Butcher, is a fictional character introduced as
                the
                antihero protagonist of the Dexter book series written by Jeff Lindsay, as well as the television series
                of
                the same name. In the television series, Dexter is portrayed by Michael C. Hall.

                In both the novels and television series, Dexter is a forensic blood spatter analyst who works for the
                fictitious Miami-Metro Police Department. In his spare time, he is a vigilante serial killer who targets
                other murderers who have evaded the justice system. Dexter follows a code of ethics taught to him in
                childhood by his adoptive father, Harry, which he refers to as "The Code" or "The Code of Harry" and
                hinges
                on two principles: He can only kill people after finding conclusive evidence that they are guilty of
                murder,
                and he must not get caught. Dexter refers to his homicidal urges as his "Dark Passenger"; when he can no
                longer ignore his need to kill, he "lets the Dark Passenger do the driving".

                Dexter's novel appearances include Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), Dearly Devoted Dexter (2005), Dexter
                in
                the Dark (2007), Dexter by Design (2009), Dexter Is Delicious (2010), Double Dexter (2011), Dexter's
                Final
                Cut (2013), and Dexter Is Dead (2015). In 2006, the first novel was adapted into the Showtime TV series
                Dexter and its companion web series Dexter: Early Cuts. Season one is largely based on the first novel,
                Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), but the following seasons veered away from the rest of the book series.

                For his performance as Dexter, Hall has received critical acclaim. In 2009, he was awarded a Golden
                Globe
                Award for Best Actor in a Television Series or Drama. Paste ranked Dexter Morgan number 6 on their list
                of
                the 20 Best Characters of 2011. In addition, Hall was awarded a Television Critics Association Award for
                Individual Achievement in Drama in 2007, and was nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for
                Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Hall reprised his role as Dexter in the miniseries Dexter: New
                Blood.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-1" id="char">Characterization</h2>
            <h3 class="h3-1">General biography</h3>
            <p class="p-2">Dexter Morgan was born in 1970. At the story's outset, Dexter remembers very little about
                his life prior to being adopted by Harry and Doris Morgan. Harry only tells Dexter that his biological
                parents both died in a car accident, and Harry brought him home from the crime scene. Harry and Doris
                have a biological daughter, Debra ("Deborah" in the novels) Morgan, who becomes Dexter's adoptive
                sister.

                When Dexter is seven, Harry discovers that the boy has been killing neighborhood pets and realizes that
                Dexter is a sociopath with an innate need to kill. Consequently, Harry decides to channel the boy's
                homicidal urges in a "positive" direction by teaching him to be a careful, meticulous killer of people
                who "deserve it"—murderers who have escaped justice. Doris died when Dexter was 16, and Harry died when
                Dexter was 20. In the second season, Dexter's nemesis, Sergeant James Doakes, discovers that Dexter
                forsook a career in medicine to pursue blood spatter analysis, despite being at the top of his class in
                medical school. He also notes that Dexter studied advanced Jiu-Jitsu in college.

                Both the television show and the first novel gradually reveal Dexter's complete back story. Dexter was
                born out of wedlock in 1971 to a young woman named Laura (Laura Moser on the show). In the novels, Laura
                was involved in the drug trade. On the show, Laura was a police informant for Harry Morgan and his
                secret mistress. Dexter's biological father was in the U.S. Army and served in the Vietnam War, but
                later became a drug-addicted criminal. Dexter also had an older brother, named Brian. When Dexter
                was two years old, he witnessed his mother's brutal murder at the hands of three drug dealers. For two
                days, Dexter and Brian were left in a crate, surrounded by dismembered body parts and sitting in a pool
                of blood. Harry adopted Dexter, while Brian was left to the child welfare system.

                Dexter only remembers his mother's murder later in life, when he is called to an extremely bloody crime
                scene left by his brother—who has also grown up to be a serial killer. In the novel, Brian escapes
                Miami, but returns in Dexter Is Delicious. On the show, however, Dexter catches and (reluctantly) kills
                Brian, aware that Brian would never stop trying to kill Debra or other innocent people.</p>

            </center>
            <h3 class="h3-2">Psychological profile</h3>
            <p class="p-3">Since childhood, Dexter has felt homicidal urges directed by an inner voice he calls "the
                Dark Passenger"; when that voice cannot be ignored, he "lets the Dark Passenger do the driving". He
                abides by a moral code taught to him by Harry: He can only kill people who are themselves murderers; he
                must find conclusive proof of their guilt before killing them; and he must be careful and methodical
                enough to avoid getting caught.

                Dexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he refers to
                "humans" as if he is not one himself. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness,
                and says he kills to feel alive. He claims to have no feelings or conscience, and that all of his
                emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. He has no interest in
                romance or sex; he considers his relationship with his girlfriend (and eventual wife) Rita Bennett to be
                part of his "disguise".

                Dexter likes children, finding them much more interesting than adults; accordingly, he treats victims
                who prey on children with particular wrath. His connection to Rita's children, Astor, and Cody,
                sometimes supersedes his relationship with Rita herself. For example, in the novels, Dexter continues
                his relationship with Rita because he realizes that Rita's children are exhibiting the same sociopathic
                tendencies he did at their age, and he tries to provide them with "guidance" similar to that which Harry
                provided him. Early in the show, Dexter deviates from his code of only killing murderers to dispose of a
                pedophile who is stalking Astor.

                Animals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when he stalks a victim who has pets. The
                novels reveal that he once owned a dog that barked and growled at him until he was forced to get rid of
                it and a turtle that hid from him in its shell until it died of starvation.

                Dexter occasionally behaves in a way that suggests that he does feel some rudimentary human connection.
                He acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly to his late adoptive father, saying: "If I were capable
                of love, how I would have loved Harry." Since Harry's death, Dexter's only family is his sister Debra,
                Harry and Doris' biological daughter. Dexter admits that he cannot hurt Debra or allow anyone else to
                harm her because he is "fond of her". In the first episode of season one, he says: "I don't have
                feelings about anything, but if I could have feelings at all, I'd have them for Deb."

                In the first season, Dexter's relationship with Rita sets in motion his gradual introduction to human
                feelings, progressing further each season. During the episode "Shrink Wrap", when his current target is
                a psychologist, Dexter infiltrates his office by posing as a patient, and the doctor astutely speculates
                that part of Dexter's problem in admitting to his feelings is his need for control; this revelation
                helps Dexter finally have real intimacy with Rita. In the second-season finale, "The British Invasion",
                Dexter finally admits that he needs the people in his life. In season three, when he is threatened by
                a target, Dexter fights to live because he wants to see his unborn child. In season four, before killing
                a police officer who has murdered her own husband and daughter, Dexter is overwhelmed with the
                realization that he does not want to lose his new family. He is also horrified when he finds out that
                one of his potential victims is an abusive husband and father; Dexter vehemently insists he is nothing
                like that and would never hurt his family.

                In season five, after Rita is murdered, Dexter realizes that he genuinely loved her, and is devastated
                by losing her. However, after Rita's death, Dexter became worse in many aspects. These ranged from
                his emotional depth to his skills as a killer, as he started to ignore killing non-killers and innocents
                if it meant he remained free; he was even willing to kill his ex-girlfriend Angela Bishop and the police
                sergeant Logan was Dexter's final victim, as well as the final violation of the Code of Harry. Despite
                the blatant violation of the Code that was Logan's murder, Dexter showed absolutely no remorse or guilt,
                instead focused solely on escaping with his son Harrison, and he even tried to justify the murder to
                Harrison. His last conversation with Harrison became a turning point for him—no longer could he consider
                himself morally superior to his victims, accepting that he himself fit the Code and that he was just
                another killer.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-2" id="dexinbooks">Dexter in the book series</h2>
            <h3 class="h3-3">Darkly Dreaming Dexter</h3>
            <p class="p-4">Doris Morgan, Dexter's adoptive mother, dies of cancer when he is 16. When Dexter reaches
                puberty, he realizes that he is uninterested in sex and needs instruction by his father on how to behave
                with women. Around this time, Harry discovers that Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets and
                realizes that the boy has an innate need to kill. Harry decides to channel Dexter's urges in a
                "positive" direction by teaching him to kill people who "deserve it", and to get rid of any evidence so
                he does not get found.

                When Dexter is 18, Harry is diagnosed with cancer and hospitalized. There, Harry gives Dexter his
                "permission" to kill his first human victim, a nurse who is murdering her patients with overdoses of
                morphine.

                Throughout the novel, Dexter is involved in the investigation of the "Tamiami Butcher", a serial killer
                who dismembers his victims and puts the body parts in refrigerated trucks. The killer begins leaving
                taunting clues for Dexter to draw him in. The killer kidnaps Deborah and meets with Dexter in a storage
                container, and reveals their true connection: he is Brian, Dexter's biological brother. Brian tells
                Dexter that as children, they witnessed their mother's brutal murder at the hands of drug dealers, and
                were locked in a crate for two days, surrounded by dead bodies. Dexter persuades Brian to spare Deborah,
                and instead the two of them kill Lieutenant Migdia LaGuerta (this does not occur in the TV series, in
                which LaGuerta—whose first name is changed to "Maria"—is a recurring character until her death at the
                end of the seventh season).

                At the end of the novel, Deborah learns of Dexter's secret life after he saves her from Brian. She
                appears to accept it, but in subsequent books feels torn between her duties as a police officer and her
                loyalty to Dexter, whom she loves as her real brother.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 class="h2-3" id="dexintelevision">Dexter in the television show</h2>
            <h3 class="h3-4">Season one</h3>
            <p class="p-5">By the start of season one, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police
                Department; in his "secret life", he is a serial killer who preys on people who are themselves
                murderers. In his private life, Dexter maintains superficial relationships – with his sister Debra
                (Jennifer Carpenter), his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), and Rita's children, Astor (Christina Robinson)
                and Cody (Daniel Goldman in season one, Preston Bailey in subsequent seasons) to appear normal. Dexter
                has internal conversations with his late foster father, Harry Morgan (James Remar), who gives him advice
                about killing and navigating his personal life.

                Rita's previous, abusive marriage leaves her afraid to have sex, which suits the asexual Dexter
                perfectly. When she overcomes her demons and becomes more amorous, however, Dexter considers ending the
                relationship, fearing that she will see him as he really is if they become a real couple. However,
                during a therapy session with one of his intended victims, psychologist Emmett Meridian (Tony Goldwyn),
                Dexter is put into a state of deep relaxation, wherein he sees a frightening image of a small boy
                sitting in a pool of blood. In a heightened emotional state, he runs to Rita's house for comfort, and
                they have sex.

                Meanwhile, a serial killer of prostitutes appears in Miami, and Dexter notices that the killer is
                leaving hidden clues at the scene that have personal significance to Dexter. One day, Dexter receives
                official notification that a man named Joseph Driscoll is his biological father, and that, since Dexter
                is the only next of kin, he must come settle the estate and claim the body. Debra's new boyfriend, Rudy
                Cooper (Christian Camargo), insists that they accompany Dexter and Rita to clean out the house. Dexter
                doubts that Driscoll is his father, but while cleaning, discovers a thank-you card that he sent his
                blood donor as a child, as Dexter has a rare blood type (AB-). As Harry had convinced Driscoll to
                donate the blood anonymously, Dexter had no idea from where it had come. Dexter suspects his
                father's death was foul play, but the body is cremated before Dexter can obtain proof. The show
                reveals to the viewer that Rudy murdered Driscoll with an injection of insulin designed to mimic a heart
                attack.

                Dexter's rivalry with Rita's recently paroled ex-husband Paul (Mark Pellegrino) turns violent; Paul
                tries to fight Dexter, who knocks him unconscious. To cover his tracks, Dexter injects Paul with heroin
                and leaves him to be found. Paul fails a drug test (thus breaking his probation) and returns to jail.

                Dexter is called to analyze a hotel room flooded with the blood of multiple persons. The sight triggers
                a panic attack and calls up several memories of himself as a child sitting in blood. His research
                leads him to discover he witnessed his mother's murder as a child, and he had a brother named Brian.
                Eventually, the Ice Truck Killer (who turns out to be Rudy) kidnaps Debra after proposing to her, then
                drugs her and takes her to Dexter's childhood home. When Dexter goes to rescue Debra, he finally
                recognizes Rudy as his long-lost brother, Brian Moser.

                Brian proposes that they begin to murder together, and leads Dexter to a bound and drugged Debra,
                suggests that she be their first kill. After wrestling with internal conflicts from his attachment to
                his biological brother and need to protect his adoptive sister, Dexter ultimately decides that his
                loyalty lies with Debra. Later on, Brian begins to hunt down Debra himself, but Dexter apprehends Brian
                and then ties him down to an operating table in Brian's apartment. Dexter tearfully slits Brian's
                throat, staging the crime scene to make it look like Brian committed suicide. Eventually, the police
                find the body and close the case. The season ends with Dexter wondering what it would be like if
                everyone knew his secrets and imagining being celebrated outside the police station by an adoring crowd.

            <h3 class="h3-5">Dexter: New Blood</h3>
            <p class="p-6">Approximately 10 years after the original series' finale, Dexter has moved to the fictional
                small town of Iron Lake, New York, posing as Jim Lindsay, a local shopkeeper. He is in a relationship
                with Angela Bishop (Julia Jones), the town's chief of police, and has abstained from killing for almost
                a decade. Debra has replaced Harry in Dexter's mind as his "Dark Passenger", albeit one who advises him
                on ways not to kill. He "falls off the wagon", however, when he impulsively murders Matt Caldwell (Steve
                M. Roberts), an arrogant stockbroker who once killed five people and got away with it thanks to his
                family's wealth and political clout.

                Caldwell is officially considered a missing person, and his father Kurt (Clancy Brown) begins nosing
                around the investigation. Dexter destroys the corpse and alters the crime scene to make it look like
                Matt left town after being injured. That night, he runs into Kurt, who drunkenly claims to have gotten a
                FaceTime message from his son. Unbeknownst to Dexter, Kurt is a serial killer who preys on runaway
                teenage girls, and is trying to get the search called off so the police will not find his victims'
                bodies.[48]

                At the same time, a now teenage Harrison (Jack Alcott) comes back into Dexter's life, having tracked him
                to Iron Lake. He says he lived in a series of foster homes after Hannah died of pancreatic cancer.
                Over Debra's objections, Dexter once again becomes a father to the boy, who quickly becomes a popular
                student and star of his school's wrestling team, and befriends Angela's adopted daughter, Audrey (Johnny
                Sequoyah). Harrison also causes Dexter to depart somewhat from his "code"; when Harrison nearly dies
                of a fentanyl overdose at a party, Dexter murders the drug dealer who sold him the pills by forcing him
                to ingest a lethal amount of the drug instead of his usual killing method, a stab wound to the
                chest.

                Harrison is injured in a knife fight with another student, Ethan Williams (Christian Dell'Edera), whom
                he badly wounds. Harrison claims that Ethan told him he was planning a school shooting and stabbed him,
                and that he stabbed Ethan back in self-defense. When it is discovered that Ethan was indeed planning to
                kill several of his classmates, Harrison is hailed as a hero, but Dexter doubts his story. Using his
                training as a blood spatter analyst, Dexter reconstructs the fight and determines that Harrison stabbed
                Ethan unprovoked, and then inflicted a superficial stab wound upon himself to make it look like Ethan
                attacked him. Dexter searches Harrison's room and finds a bloody straight razor—the same kind of blade
                that Arthur Mitchell used to kill Rita—and realizes that his son has inherited his homicidal
                tendencies.

                During a chance meeting with Angel Batista (now Captain of Miami Metro) at a police conference in New
                York City, Angela learns about Dexter Morgan's supposed death, and after some investigation discovers
                the true identity of "Jim Lindsay". Dexter tells her the truth about faking his death—while leaving
                out that he is a serial killer—but she breaks up with him regardless. This causes awkwardness between
                them after she catches Harrison in bed with Audrey.

                Meanwhile, true crime podcaster Molly Park (Jamie Chung) arrives in town to do a story about Matt
                Caldwell, and Dexter discovers that she did a series on the Bay Harbor Butcher. He becomes obsessed with
                finding out what she knows, especially after Harrison reveals that he learned the truth about Rita's
                death from her show. He spies on her talking to Kurt, who lies that his son is hiding out at the family
                cabin, in order to lure her out there and kill her. Dexter reluctantly saves her and gets a closer look
                at what he correctly suspects to be Kurt's killing ground. Dexter grows alarmed as Kurt becomes a
                mentor to Harrison, especially after he encourages the boy to break another student's arm during a
                wrestling match.

                When Angela finds the mummified corpse of her friend Iris, who disappeared 25 years earlier, she asks
                Dexter to analyze the remains, and tells him that she suspects Kurt of killing her. Dexter leads her
                toward investigating Kurt as a serial killer in hopes that exposing his crimes will destroy his
                influence over Harrison. She arrests Kurt for Iris' murder, but Kurt surprises her by saying that his
                late father, Roger, committed the crime. (A flashback reveals that Kurt did indeed kill her, however.)
                When Kurt is released, he tries to intimidate Dexter by hinting that he knows he killed Matt, and Dexter
                realizes that he will have to kill Kurt to protect Harrison and himself.

                Kurt pays one of his truckers, Elric Kane (Shuler Hensley), to kidnap Dexter so he can kill him and
                Harrison, but Dexter manages to evade and kill him. Dexter arrives at Kurt's cabin just in time to save
                Harrison from Kurt, who runs off. He tells Harrison that they have the same "Dark Passenger", and for
                the first time truly bonds with his son. At first, Dexter tells Harrison that he merely "confronts"
                murderers to make them stop killing, but Harrison eventually figures out that Dexter kills his victims.
                Harrison reveals that he remembers seeing Mitchell kill Rita, and that he has been consumed with a
                violent rage ever since. He then says that Kurt deserves to die, and father and son set out to kill
                him.

                Together, they find Kurt's victims, including Park, perfectly preserved and displayed in a bunker
                underneath his house. Dexter intentionally triggers an alarm to let Kurt know they found his hiding
                place. As intended, Kurt rushes back to his house, where Dexter incapacitates him and prepares a kill
                site in Kurt's own bunker. When Kurt claims that he "saved" his victims from lives of pain and
                suffering, Dexter kills him as Harrison watches, and resolves to teach him "the Code of Harry". They
                return to Dexter's cabin to find that Kurt had burned it down the night before. They stay with Angela
                and Audrey, now Harrison's girlfriend, and start to bond as a family—until Angela finds evidence, left
                by Kurt, exposing Dexter as Matt's murderer. She then sees a connection between that proof and new
                evidence uncovered by Park on the Bay Harbor Butcher case, and realizes that Dexter is the killer.

                In the finale episode, "Sins of the Father", Angela arrests Dexter for Matt's murder. At the station,
                Angela tells Dexter that she suspects him of being the Bay Harbor Butcher. While she interrogates him at
                the station, Dexter says that Kurt killed Matt and is framing him, and tells her she can find proof that
                Kurt murdered numerous women in the bunker. Distracted, Angela leaves the station to go to Kurt's cabin.
                Dexter lures her deputy, Logan (Alano Miller), closer to his cell and then puts him in a headlock,
                demanding Logan release him. Logan reaches for his gun and attempts to shoot Dexter, but misses. Dexter
                breaks Logan's neck, steals his keys and flees the station after having contacted Harrison using Logan's
                phone.

                He meets up with Harrison and tells his son to leave town with him. Harrison sees blood on Dexter's
                face, however, and figures out that he killed Logan, Harrison's wrestling coach who had been a friend
                and mentor to him. Horrified, Harrison says that Dexter's "code" is a lie he tells himself to justify
                the murders he enjoys committing, and that if not for him, Rita and Debra would be alive and he would
                have grown up normal and happy. Dexter reflects on all the innocent people in his life who have died
                because of him, and finally sees that he can never be the good man and father that he wants to be. He
                tells Harrison that the only way out for both of them is for Harrison to kill him. After a moment's
                hesitation, Harrison shoots Dexter in the chest with the hunting rifle Dexter gave him for Christmas.
                Dexter tells Harrison he "did good" as he succumbs to his wounds, and sees Debra holding his hand as he
                dies. Moments later, Angela arrives at the scene and allows Harrison to escape. Harrison leaves Iron
                Lake, and reads the goodbye letter Dexter wrote to Hannah 10 years earlier, telling her to "let me die
                so my son can live".</p>
