            <p>Life of Pi is a 2012 adventure-drama film directed and produced by Ang Lee and written by David Magee.
                Based
                on Yann Martel's 2001 novel, it stars Suraj Sharma in his film debut, Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Rafe Spall,
                Gérard
                Depardieu and Adil Hussain in lead roles. The storyline revolves around two survivors of a shipwreck who
                are
                on a lifeboat stranded in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days. One is a sixteen-year-old Indian boy named Pi
                Patel (Suraj Sharma) and the other is a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.

                The film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors M. Night
                Shyamalan,
                Alfonso Cuarón and Jean-Pierre Jeunet involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was
                split
                between India, Taiwan and Montreal in 2011, with Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H) handling the visual effects
                work.

                The film had its worldwide premiere as the opening film of the 50th New York Film Festival at both the
                Walter Reade Theater and Alice Tully Hall in New York City on September 28, 2012. It was theatrically
                released in the U.S. on November 21 by 20th Century Fox. Life of Pi became a commercial success, having
                grossed over $609 million, and received generally positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for
                three
                Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture – Drama and Best Director, and won for Golden Globe Award
                for
                Best Original Score. At the 85th Academy Awards, it had eleven nominations, including Best Picture and
                Best
                Adapted Screenplay, and won four, including Best Director for Ang Lee.</p>
