            <p class="p-1">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It
                has a
                muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of
                its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
                It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males,
                related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized
                and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
                prey on humans.

                The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild
                cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic
                period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been
                reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
                listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
                declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected
                areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
                are the greatest causes for concern.

                One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively
                depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been
                kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition
                in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were
                prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures
                in the lion's historic and current range.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-1" id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
            <p class="p-2">The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem (nominative: leō),
                which in
                turn
                was a borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων léōn. The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related. The
                generic name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word
                πάνθηρ 'panther'.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2 class="h2-2" id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
            <p class="p-3">Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in
                his work
                Systema Naturae. The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th
                and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were
                recognised as valid in 2005. They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and
                skins.
            </p>
            <h3>Subspecies</h3>
            <p class="p-4">In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as
                subspecies,
                with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017. Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List
                assessors used only two subspecific names: P. l. leo for African lion populations, and P. l. persica for
                the Asiatic lion population. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist
                Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic
                studies on lion evolution, namely</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="li-1">P. l. leo (Linnaeus, 1758) − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion,
                    the regionally
                    extinct Barbary lion, and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa.
                    Synonyms include P. l. persica (Meyer, 1826), P. l. senegalensis (Meyer, 1826), P. l. kamptzi
                    (Matschie, 1900), and P. l. azandica (Allen, 1924). Multiple authors referred to it as 'northern
                    lion' and 'northern subspecies'.</li>
                <li class="li-2">P. l. melanochaita (Smith, 1842) − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations
                    in East and
                    Southern African regions. Synonyms include P. l. somaliensis (Noack 1891), P. l. massaica
                    (Neumann, 1900), P. l. sabakiensis (Lönnberg, 1910), P. l. bleyenberghi (Lönnberg, 1914), P. l.
                    roosevelti (Heller, 1914), P. l. nyanzae (Heller, 1914), P. l. hollisteri (Allen, 1924), P. l.
                    krugeri (Roberts, 1929), P. l. vernayi (Roberts, 1948), and P. l. webbiensis (Zukowsky,
                    1964). It has been referred to as 'southern subspecies' and 'southern lion'.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-5">However, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in northern Central
                Africa. DNA
                analysis from a more recent study indicates that Central African lions are derived from both
                northern and southern lions, as they cluster with P. leo leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas
                their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. leo melanochaita.</p>
            <p class="p-6">Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from
                Cameroon
                and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa.
                Researchers, therefore, assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies.[18]
                Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with P.
                l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita. This result
                suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.</p>
